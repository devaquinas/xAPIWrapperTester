xAPIWrapperTester
=================

A form I'm using to test all the xAPI calls needed for our learning modules. Depends on the ADL xAPI Wrapper.
UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. 

1. Edit config.js to point to the desired LRS
Directions for editing config.js:
https://github.com/adlnet/xAPIWrapper#configuration

What this does:

1. Generates fairly complex statements, including Interactions, Results, etc. More coming soon.
2. Sends statements to an LRS
3. Sends and Gets State
4. demonstrates getting very specific pieces of the State dataset
5. Sends Agent Profiles.
